# mach.d

A general-purpose library for the D programming language.

Distributed under the very permissive [zlib/libpng license](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/blob/master/license).

Be warned: "Stability" is meaningless in the context of this library. I am constantly rewriting and improving and breaking code.

That said, I take some pride in the thoroughness of this library's unit tests. Said tests are frequently verified on Win 7 with 32-bit dmd, and occassionally verified on OSX 10.9.5 with 64-bit dmd.

Maybe I'll think about a versioning system and proper releases once the content and foci of this library have been better-established, but honestly that may never happen. I'm really just writing whatever interests me, or that I need to support another project I'm persuing, and this repo is here to share with the world because FOSS is the best.

The majority of this package depends only on D's standard library, Phobos.

The `mach.sdl` package requires some additional dependencies. See the [package readme](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d/blob/master/mach/sdl/readme.md) for details.
