# mach.d

A general-purpose library for the D programming language.

Depends only on D's standard library, Phobos.

Except for mach.sdl.*, which also requires the Derelict bindings for [SDL2](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictSDL2) and [OpenGL](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictGL3).

Under construction.
