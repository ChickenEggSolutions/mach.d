### mach.error.assertf

Is to `assert` as `writefln` is to `writeln`.

### mach.error.mixins

Mixins for building throwable exception classes without rewriting the same set of default constructors every time.

### mach.error.unit

Prettier and more comprehendable output than if you just used `assert` for all your unit tests.
